### Available magic exports

https://x.com/zebassembly/status/1886864368656158842

Currently you can export functions called action/loader/clientLoader/clientAction which can be found in the RR documentation, and then you can export any class that extends RouteDurableObject, WorkerEntrypoint, or WorkflowEntrypoint to be used in the data layer.
